# How does Crisp Chat SDK for Android work?

Crisp Chat works for both logged in and logged out users as well as users juggling between multiple devices. Itâ€™s worth reading the detailed instructions about session continuity.

You can open the chat widget from a button in your mobile app, programmatically when someone does a custom action, or from a persistent button that is available in your mobile app.

When your customers open Crisp Widget, they are presented with a chat widget or a help widget.

From there, your customer can search for help articles or start a conversation. A conversation goes to your inbox inside your Crisp Workspace, and replies in both directions happen in real time.
